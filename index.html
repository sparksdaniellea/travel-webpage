                <h3>Why Boston?</h3>
                <h2>Boston, the "Cradle of Liberty"</h2>
                <p>Boston is often celebrated as the cradle of liberty due to its pivotal role in shaping the early history of the United States. This historic city played a central role in the American Revolution, hosting events like the Boston Tea Party and the Battles of Lexington and Concord. These acts of defiance against British colonial rule marked the birth of a revolutionary spirit that ultimately led to the Declaration of Independence in 1776.</p> 
                <p>Boston's Faneuil Hall, nicknamed the "Cradle of Liberty," was a gathering place for passionate discussions and the site of numerous pivotal meetings and speeches by renowned figures like Samuel Adams and John Adams. The city's commitment to freedom and its significant contributions to the formation of the nation's democratic ideals have solidified its reputation as the cradle of liberty in American history.</p>
